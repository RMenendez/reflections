1 When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

The main reason is to share the repository with other people, so they can look at it or we can work in a collaborating way.


2 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

As with the manual vs automatic commit, with the manual pulling of changes you have more control of what you do.
